# syn_flood
A SYN Flood Attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the TCP three-way handshake process. The attacker sends a high volume of SYN requests to a target system but never completes the handshake, exhausting the serverâ€™s resources and making it unavailable for legitimate users.
